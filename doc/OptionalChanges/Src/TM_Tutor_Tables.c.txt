-----------------------------------
DPE Master/Src/TM_Tutor_Tables.c
-----------------------------------
This is where you define the moves taught via TM and Move Tutors.
Editing this file is really simple.

----------
TMs
----------
Open include/moves.h to use as a reference of moves you want to include.
In the existing TM Table, you can replace the values with the moves you want in your specific TM order.
If you want less than 120 TMs, edit Src/defines.h to determine the number of TMs+HMs, and edit CFRU's Src/config.h file accordingly.

Syntax:

const u16 gTMHMMoves[NUM_TMSHMS] =
{
	MOVE_FOCUSPUNCH,	//1
	MOVE_DRAGONCLAW,	//2
	MOVE_WATERPULSE,	//3
...
	MOVE_ROCKSMASH,		//126
	MOVE_WATERFALL,		//127
	MOVE_ROCKCLIMB,		//128
};

When changing the entries for TMs and HMs, customize the files found in the Src/tm_compatability/ folder.
More details are provided in that section of customizable files!

When you finished that setup, there is an additional step for TMs.
Open up G3T's item editor.
Assuming you customized your TM table, you will need to change the palettes of the TMs to match the move type.
Look at existing TM palettes and switch em around to your liking.
You must edit move descriptions as well. 
If you are using expanded moves after the original Gen 3 table, revisit this after inserting CFRU.
CFRU actually inserts the new move data, so you won't have a description offset to work with until then.
Open G3T's move editor, find the move, and copy the offset for its description.

Idea for TMs and TRs:
----------------------/
**THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED, ITS JUST AN IDEA**
Customize however many TMs you want for your hack, and have TRs immediately after. Both would be loaded from the TM compatibility table.
For example, I want 50 TMs, 8 HMs and 70 TRs. After MOVE_OVERHEAT and before MOVE_CUT would be the TR's.

In CFRU's src/config.h, define infinite use TMs. 
In G3T's item editor, change the TM hidden byte values to 1 for infinite use, but leave your TRs at 0.
If you dont know what this means, look at the CFRU documentation.
Change TM51-TM120 to TR51-TR120 in the name table to be consistent.

This should make the TRs sellable and destructable, as well as giving you the ability to obtain multiple.
**AGAIN, I HAVE NOT TESTED THIS AND DO NOT KNOW IF IT WORKS. ITS JUST AN IDEA THAT CROSSED MY MIND**

----------
Tutors
----------
Unlike TMs, this is one of two tables that need to be edited to customize Move Tutors and their order in the table.
The other one is located in DPE Master/Include/tutors.h
BOTH MUST MATCH!
Unlike tutors.h however, move names must be defined by the values in Include/move.h, so DO NOT ADD SPACES TO THE NAMES IN THIS ONE.

Syntax:

const u16 gMoveTutorMoves[NUM_MOVE_TUTOR_MOVES] =
{
	MOVE_FIREPUNCH,			//1
	MOVE_ICEPUNCH,			//2
	MOVE_THUNDERPUNCH,		//3
...
	MOVE_MEGAHORN,			//126
	MOVE_POWERWHIP,			//127
	MOVE_SOLARBLADE,		//128
};

There is no need to define the additional 8 Tutors found in the tutors.h file. Those are handled by DPE and CFRU.

When changing the entries for Move Tutors, customize the files found in the Src/tutor_compatability/ folder.
More details are provided in that section of customizable files!
