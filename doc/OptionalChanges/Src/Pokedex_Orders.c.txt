DPE Master/Src/Pokedex_Orders.c
-----------------------------------

This file contains 5 different tables for you to edit. They are as follows:

1. Custom Regional Dex
2. Alphabetical Order Dex
3. Weight Dex Order
4. Height Dex Order
5. Type Dex Order

----------
TABLE 1
----------
For the first table, it is configured to be the original Kanto 151.
I have not extensively tested its limitations. Play around with it.
If you can create a custom dex with like 400 Pokemon, more power to you.
In CFRU's include/config.h, change the regional dex define # afterwards.

Syntax/Example: 

const u16 gPokedexOrder_Regional[] =
{
	SPECIES_BULBASAUR,
...
	SPECIES_MEW,
};

const u16 gRegionalDexCount = ARRAY_COUNT(gPokedexOrder_Regional);

----------
TABLE 2
----------
For the second table, organize every Pokemon you want in your rom in alphabetical order. Do not include alternate forms.

Syntax/Example:

const u16 gPokedexOrder_Alphabetical[] =
{
	SPECIES_ABOMASNOW,
...
	SPECIES_ZYGARDE,
};

const u16 gPokedexOrderAlphabeticalCount = ARRAY_COUNT(gPokedexOrder_Alphabetical);

----------
TABLE 3
----------
For the third table, organize every Pokemon you want in your rom by order of Weight. Do not include alternate forms.
Bulbapedia is a good resource for this.

Syntax/Example:

const u16 gPokedexOrder_Weight[] =
{
	SPECIES_GASTLY,
...
	SPECIES_CELESTEELA,
};

const u16 gPokedexOrderWeightCount = ARRAY_COUNT(gPokedexOrder_Weight);

----------
TABLE 4
----------
For the fourth table, organize every Pokemon you want in your rom by order of Height. Do not include alternate forms.
Bulbapedia is a good resource for this.

Syntax/Example:

const u16 gPokedexOrder_Height[] =
{
	SPECIES_JOLTIK,
...
	SPECIES_WAILORD,
};

const u16 gPokedexOrderHeightCount = ARRAY_COUNT(gPokedexOrder_Height);

----------
TABLE 5
----------
For the final table, things get a bit trickier than the first four.
By default Pokemon types are ordered as such:

Normal
Fighting
Flying
Poison
Ground
Rock
Bug
Ghost
Steel
Fire
Water
Grass
Electric
Psychic
Ice
Dragon
Dark 
Fairy

Problem is, what do we do with dual types?
Well after the final pure normal type in national dex order, (lets just say Komala for now), we start adding Normal/Fighting types. Then Normal/Flying... Normal/Fairy. Then Fighting/Flying to Fighting/Fairy, etc.
Oh, by the way, this table includes alternate forms with different types, BUT NOT REGIONAL FORMS.
Or add them if you want, your hack.

So for Example
:
const u16 gPokedexOrder_Type[] =
{
	SPECIES_RATTATA,
	SPECIES_RATICATE,
...
	SPECIES_SILVALLY,
	SPECIES_KOMALA,
	SPECIES_MELOETTA_PIROUETTE,
	SPECIES_STUFFUL,
	SPECIES_BEWEAR,
	SPECIES_PIDGEY,
	SPECIES_PIDGEOTTO,
...
	SPECIES_WIGGLYTUFF,
	SPECIES_IGGLYBUFF,
	SPECIES_AZURILL,
	SPECIES_MANKEY,
...
	SPECIES_XERNEAS,
	SPECIES_COMFEY,
	SPECIES_TOGETIC,
	SPECIES_TOGEKISS,
};

Notice how the fairy types with a secondary type are last.
I may as well type it up to help you keep track, because I know some of you are going to keep asking me if I don't.
Types should go in this order:

Normal
Normal/Fighting
