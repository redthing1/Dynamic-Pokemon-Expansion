DPE Master/Src/Species_To_Pokedex_Table.c
--------------------------------------------

This is a table that determines which species of Pokemon is linked to what Pokedex entry.
The species table is found in Include/species.h, the dex entries are found in Include/pokedex.h.

Syntax:

const u16 gSpeciesToNationalPokedexNum[NUM_SPECIES - 1] =
{
	[SPECIES_BULBASAUR - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_BULBASAUR,
	[SPECIES_IVYSAUR - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_IVYSAUR,
	[SPECIES_VENUSAUR - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_VENUSAUR,
...
	[SPECIES_VENUSAUR_MEGA - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_VENUSAUR,
	[SPECIES_CHARIZARD_MEGA_X - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_CHARIZARD,
	[SPECIES_CHARIZARD_MEGA_Y - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_CHARIZARD,
...
	[SPECIES_RATTATA_A - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_RATTATA,
	[SPECIES_RATICATE_A - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_RATICATE,
...
	[SPECIES_PIKACHU_CAP_PARTNER - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_PIKACHU,
	[SPECIES_PICHU_SPIKY - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_PICHU,
	[SPECIES_XERNEAS_NATURAL - 1] = NATIONAL_DEX_XERNEAS,
};

And so forth.

Notice that alternate forms are linked to the original Pokedex entry defined in the first list of Include/pokedex.h.
This means that Megas, Alolan and Galarian forms, Gigantamax, etc. are all linked to the original species entry.
Ensure every species is linked to an entry!
