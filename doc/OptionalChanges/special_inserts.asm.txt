DPE Master/special_inserts.asm
---------------------------------

This file is a very simple one to change.
The only ones you should really pay attention to are lines 5 and 7.

By default, they are:

.equ NUM_SPECIES, 1102

.equ FINAL_DEX_ENTRY, 809

When you have configured your species table and how many National Dex entries you want, change those numbers accordingly.
Note that they are in decimal form, not hex, if that wasn't obvious enough.

The rest of the file can be left alone with little issue.
