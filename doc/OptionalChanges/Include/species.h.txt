DPE Master/Include/species.h
---------------------------------

Note: You can customize your own species table, but be aware that you have to change EVERYTHING PKMN RELATED!
Note: It is best for your sanity to just add new slots to the end of the table rather than removing or replacing existing ones.
Note: CFRU Documentation provides a list of pokemon who you shouldn't really mess with.
Note: If creating a more limited Pokedex is what you are concerned with, just insert the excess anyway and customize the Dex Tables.
Note: Be sure to change #define NUM_SPECIES at the end to the final pokemon in the table + 1

This must match the species list in the CFRU repository as well!
