DPE Master/Src/Egg_Moves.c
-----------------------------

This file configures egg moves that each pokemon can learn.

Here is how it is structured:

const u16 gEggMoves[] =
{
	egg_moves(BULBASAUR,
		MOVE_SKULLBASH,
		MOVE_CHARM,
		MOVE_PETALDANCE,
		MOVE_MAGICALLEAF,
		MOVE_GRASSWHISTLE,
		MOVE_CURSE,
		MOVE_INGRAIN,
		MOVE_NATUREPOWER,
		MOVE_AMNESIA,
		MOVE_LEAFSTORM,
		MOVE_POWERWHIP,
		MOVE_SLUDGE,
		MOVE_ENDURE,
		MOVE_GIGADRAIN,
		MOVE_GRASSYTERRAIN),

	egg_moves(CHARMANDER,
		MOVE_BELLYDRUM,
		MOVE_ANCIENTPOWER,
		MOVE_BITE,
		MOVE_OUTRAGE,
		MOVE_BEATUP,
		MOVE_DRAGONDANCE,
		MOVE_CRUNCH,
		MOVE_DRAGONRUSH,
		MOVE_METALCLAW,
		MOVE_FLAREBLITZ,
		MOVE_COUNTER,
		MOVE_DRAGONPULSE,
		MOVE_FOCUSPUNCH,
		MOVE_AIRCUTTER),
...
	egg_moves(ORICORIO_S,
		MOVE_PLUCK,
		MOVE_TAILWIND,
		MOVE_SAFEGUARD,
		MOVE_CAPTIVATE),
};

Note a few things: 
The table only includes first forms only.
The moves are defined based on Include/moves.h
The ( comes before the Pokemon's name, and the ) comes after the last move, but before the last comma.
Alternate forms can have egg moves too.
