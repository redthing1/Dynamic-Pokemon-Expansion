Note: You can create your own custom moves. Read the CFRU Documentation for more details.
Note: If you create new moves, place them AFTER Dragon Energy and BEFORE the Z-Moves. Change NON_Z_MOVE_COUNT at the end.

The Syntax is as follows:

#define MOVE_MOVENAME 0x(Hex #)
Make sure you change the Hexidecimal index # of everything after it in the table!

Make sure this file matches the moves file in the CFRU repository!
