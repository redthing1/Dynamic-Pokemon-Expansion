-----------------------------------------

This file works in conjunction with include/pokedex.h

NOTE: EACH ENTRY MUST MATCH THE TABLE ORDER DEFINED IN PART 2 OF INCLUDE/POKEDEX.H

Each dex entry cannot exceed 3 lines of dialogue.
A healthy character limit per line should be about 34-40 characters, depending on formatting.

The syntax:

#org @DEX_ENTRY_NAME
Abcdefg \nAbcdefg\nAbcdefg

\n indicates a new line of text

When writing the word Pokemon use the following text: Pok\emon

Do not copy paste the entry directly from Bulbapedia or PokemonDB, it produces a syntax error sometimes.
Write each entry out by hand.
