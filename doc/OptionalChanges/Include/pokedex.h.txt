DPE Master/Include/pokedex.h
---------------------------------

This file is where you define the National Pokedex Order.
You can customize this to your liking.

The file is divided into two parts:
1. The national dex species defines
2. The dex entry table

For Part 1:

The syntax is #define NATIONAL_DEX_NAME ###

Create your national dex order as you will.
Make sure FINAL_DEX_ENTRY and NATIONAL_DEX_COUNT ends with the final entry of the table.

For Part 2:

This section defines the text entries for each dex entry.
These text entries are written out in Strings/Pokedex_Data.string!

As DPE offers support for creating entries for alternate forms, you may define alt forms as you see fit.
Or none at all. Your rom hack, your choice.

The syntax is:

extern const u8 DEX_ENTRY_NAME[];
