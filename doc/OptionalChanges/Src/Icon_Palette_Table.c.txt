DPE Master/Src/Icon_Palette_Table.c
--------------------------------------------

This file determines which pokemon species is linked to the icon palettes defined in Include/sprite_data.h

Syntax:

{
	[SPECIES_NONE] = 0x0,
	[SPECIES_BULBASAUR] = 0x1,
	[SPECIES_IVYSAUR] = 0x1,
	[SPECIES_VENUSAUR] = 0x1,
	[SPECIES_CHARMANDER] = 0x0,
	[SPECIES_CHARMELEON] = 0x0,
	[SPECIES_CHARIZARD] = 0x0,
	[SPECIES_SQUIRTLE] = 0x0,
	[SPECIES_WARTORTLE] = 0x2,
	[SPECIES_BLASTOISE] = 0x2,
...
	[SPECIES_PIKACHU_CAP_PARTNER] = 0x0,
	[SPECIES_PICHU_SPIKY] = 0x1,
	[SPECIES_XERNEAS_NATURAL] = 0x0,
};

Note how the species is linked to an offset that is either 0x0, 0x1 or 0x2.
The icons each have 3 palettes to choose from, and every public resource is tailored to one of them.
If you inserted a new species or some sort of fakemon, I really do not know which palette you should link to it.

In a vanilla rom that you aren't using to build a hack or DPE with, using PGE you can manually insert the icons you aren't sure about and then mess around with the palette there, then come back to this table.
That is the only way I can really see you knowing which of the 3 palettes fits best.

Make sure every species defined in Include/species.h has one!
