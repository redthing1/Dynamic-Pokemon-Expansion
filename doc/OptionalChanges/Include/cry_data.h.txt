DPE Master/Include/cry_data.h
---------------------------------
This file is simple, it defines the cries to be inserted into the rom.
Please note a few things:

The Syntax for each entry is as follows: 
extern u8 gCryX[]; 	Where X= Pokemon name (no need to capitalize the whole thing).

Try to keep the cry entries in order.

---------------------
Adding New Entries
---------------------
Part A: If you added new cries, you must place the sound files in the Audio folder.
When added to the Audio folder they must be organized as such.

gCryX.wav	Where X= Pokemon name (again no need to capitalize the whole name)

Part B: Afterwards, you must create a text file with a name that matches it, like so:

gCryX_flags.txt

Part C: This file only needs to contain the following text:
-c

That's it. You're done. Do this for every new entry you create.

Generation 8 Cries
---------------------
You may be wondering about the Gen 8 cry resource found here:
https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=432636 

It is incompatible with DPE and will not work when used.
Skeli has told me that he has someone working on the cries for him and DPE will eventually be updated.
Don't pester him about it.
