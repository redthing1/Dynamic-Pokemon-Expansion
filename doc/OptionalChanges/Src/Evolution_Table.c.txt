DPE Master/Src/Evolution_Table.c
-----------------------------------
This table defines Pokemon evolutions. There are a max of 16 slots for you to occupy.
The following is copied over from the required edits file:

**This defines the evolution paths that every Pokemon will take in your rom**
**Do not fret, you can edit this in G3T after the fact, though Habitat Evolutions will need hex editing**
**You can also change evolution methods around to your liking, your hack, your choice**

**The syntax required is [SPECIES_NAME] =  {{EVOMETHOD, (Level, item, etc.), SPECIES, 0 }},
  For branched evolutions: [SPECIES_NAME] =  {{EVOMETHOD, (Level, item, etc.), SPECIES, 0 },
						{EVOMETHOD, (Level, item, etc.), SPECIES, 0 }},

Replace the 0 at the end with MEGA_VARIANT_STANDARD/PRIMAL/WISH/ULTRA_BURST for mega evolutions.**

The file is organized into the following parts:

1- Link Cable configuration
2- Editing Include/evolution.h map locations
3- Changing or Removing Unbound map evolutions
4- Changing or removing Trade evolutions (optional)
5- Gigantamax

-------------------------------------/
Part 1- Link Cable Compatibility
-------------------------------------/

01. First thing's first, replace every instance of ITEM_LINK_STONE with ITEM_LINK_CABLE.

-------------------------------------/
Part 2- Map Locations
-------------------------------------/
Secondly, you will notice some evolutions have locations found specifically in Pokemon Unbound.
This will require a few things to do first, including editing another file.
If you do not wish to include Map Based evolutions in your hack, move on to Part 3.

02A. Navigate to Include/evolution.h

**This file is what defines evolution methods, and locations you can pull from**

02B. Scroll to the bottom and you will find location defines starting with "#define MAP_NAME_ROUTE_1 0x65"

**Map defines must match the ones found in the CFRU file: CFRU Master Folder/include/constants/region_map_sections.h**
**You can remove the ones you aren't using, as well as change the names to match your hack's map names**

02C. Remove that entire bottom table and replace it with the ones you want to use.

This is the vanilla table found in CFRU's region_map_sections.h file:

02D. In doing this, you can now correctly define map locations for the evolution tables in your rom.

-------------------------------------/
Part 3- Changing Unbound Map Evos
-------------------------------------/

03. Navigate back to DPE Master/Src/evolution_table.c again
    It is time to remove or replace every instance of Map Locations configured for Unbound.

03A. Locate every instance of EVO_MAP you can find. Replace them with your preferred method of evolution.

-------------------------------------/
Part 4- Trade Evos
-------------------------------------/
04. Next, you can optionally remove the Trade Evolutions, or leave them alone. CFRU supports multiplayer, so up to you.

**For Trade Evos, an alternate evolution path (usually an item) is defined.
  If you really feel the need to remove them, here is an example of how:**

Make: 
[SPECIES_KADABRA] =          {{EVO_TRADE, 0, SPECIES_ALAKAZAM, 0},
						  {EVO_ITEM, ITEM_LINK_STONE, SPECIES_ALAKAZAM, 0}},

Into: 
[SPECIES_KADABRA] =          {{EVO_ITEM, ITEM_LINK_CABLE, SPECIES_ALAKAZAM, 0}},


Again:
**The syntax required is [SPECIES_NAME] =  {{EVOMETHOD, (Level, item, etc.), SPECIES, 0 }},
  For branched evolutions: [SPECIES_NAME] =  {{EVOMETHOD, (Level, item, etc.), SPECIES, 0 },
						{EVOMETHOD, (Level, item, etc.), SPECIES, 0 }},

Replace the 0 at the end with MEGA_VARIANT_STANDARD/PRIMAL/WISH/ULTRA_BURST for mega evolutions.**

-------------------------------------/
Part 5- Gigantamax
-------------------------------------/

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: 

CFRU allows for Gigantamax to be used in battle, however we run into a problem:
We lack the resources to actually put them in the game completely.

What I mean by this is that G-Max forms, along with the rest of Generation 8 are not ready to be inserted into a rom yet.
First: Generation 8 needs cry resources, which Skeli has mentioned that he has people working on.
Second: We need sprites and icons. Which as of the above date are nowhere near complete for Gen 8.

You can probably insert the sprites of a few forms like Charizard or Alcremie, but the majority are not made as of the time writing this document.

As a result, it is best to not use Gigantamax in your hack unless all the resources for the ones you want are available.
After all, you should only insert DPE and CFRU once.

**DISCLAIMER: As time goes on, the above paragraphs should become less relevant.
**If all cries, sprites and icons are available at the time of you downloading this, then disregard the above statements.


That aside, here is what you should do when you want to add G-Max (DPE currently has official ones commented out):

01. Navigate to your Pokemon in question that can Gigantamax.
    Using Venusaur as an example, in the evolution table place the following:

	{EVO_GIGANTAMAX, TRUE, SPECIES_VENUSAUR_GIGA, 0}

Replace VENUSAUR_GIGA with X_GIGA for other pokemon. MIND THE SYNTAX!

02. At the very end of the evolution table, we must place the reversion, much like Mega Evolutions.
Lets use Venusaur again to remain in line with #1.

To revert species:

[SPECIES_VENUSAUR_GIGA] =    {{EVO_GIGANTAMAX, FALSE, SPECIES_VENUSAUR, 0}},

-------------------------------------/
Part 5B- Toxtricity and Alcremie
-------------------------------------/

03. Toxtricity presents a special case. It has two forms, both become one G-Max form.
    For the purposes of DPE, no they don't.

SPECIES_TOXTRICITY becomes SPECIES_TOXTRICITY_GIGA
SPECIES_TOXTRICITY_LOW_KEY becomes SPECIES_TOXTRICITY_LOW_KEY_GIGA

Just match the same sprite, cry and moveset. This distinction needed to happen due to differing abilities.

04. Just when you thought Toxtricity was weird, Alcremie is something else entirely.
DPE did not create all 63 forms of Alcremie. You are a madman if you put that in your rom hack.

DPE instead defines by default the forms via evolution method instead:

ALCREMIE_STRAWBERRY
ALCREMIE_BERRY
ALCREMIE_LOVE
ALCREMIE_CLOVER
ALCREMIE_FLOWER
ALCREMIE_RIBBON
ALCREMIE_STAR

Like Toxtricity, in Sword and Shield they all become one G-Max form.
Unlike Toxtricity, match the reversion to SPECIES_ALCREMIE_STRAWBERRY anyway. 

Skeli has explained that the rom will automatically revert back to the Alcremie form you used as a failsafe.
The species reversion is mainly for the G-Max forms you encounter in the wild or static encounters (not that you should do that for your hack).
There is probably a better way to explain what I just said, but what actually matters to you, dear reader, is don't bother with Alcremie's reversions.
