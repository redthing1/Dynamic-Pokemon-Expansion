DPE Master/Src/Learnsets.c
-----------------------------------

This file is where you would customize the level up moves for each pokemon.
This is assuming IF you did not comment out #define EXPAND_LEARNSETS in Src/defines.h
If you did comment out (you added //) #define EXPAND_LEARNSETS then you would change the Learnsets table in CFRU instead.

Syntax/Example:

static const struct LevelUpMove sEmptyMoveset[] = {
	LEVEL_UP_END
};

static const struct LevelUpMove sBulbasaurLevelUpLearnset[] = {
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 1, MOVE_TACKLE),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 3, MOVE_GROWL),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 7, MOVE_LEECHSEED),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 9, MOVE_VINEWHIP),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(13, MOVE_POISONPOWDER),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(13, MOVE_SLEEPPOWDER),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(15, MOVE_TAKEDOWN),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(19, MOVE_RAZORLEAF),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(21, MOVE_SWEETSCENT),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(25, MOVE_GROWTH),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(27, MOVE_DOUBLEEDGE),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(31, MOVE_WORRYSEED),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(33, MOVE_SYNTHESIS),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(37, MOVE_SEEDBOMB),
	LEVEL_UP_END
};


For every Pokemon in the table (which should be in species order), you must write:

static const struct LevelUpMove sNameLevelUpLearnset[] = {
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE(LEVEL, MOVE_MOVENAME),
...
	LEVEL_UP_END
};

Moves can be found in Include/moves.h

Additionally, if you wanted to instead define moves that are learned upon evolution (like Delphox learning Mystical Fire):

The first move or moves in the table should be Level 0.
The level 0 moves should also be included as Level 1 moves for move relearner compatibility.

	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 0, MOVE_MYSTICALFIRE),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 1, MOVE_MYSTICALFIRE),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 1, MOVE_SHADOWBALL),
	LEVEL_UP_MOVE( 1, MOVE_TRICK),
...

But we are not done!
When we type the line "static const struct LevelUpMove sNameLevelUpLearnset[] = {", where is this name loaded from?
How does DPE know that LevelUpMove sDelphoxLevelUpLearnset goes to Delphox?

-----------------------------
Part 2
-----------------------------

The second table at the very end is how.
This table defines which species is linked to which define from part 1.
Here is how it works:

const struct LevelUpMove* const gLevelUpLearnsets[NUM_SPECIES] =
{
	[SPECIES_NONE] = sEmptyMoveset,
	[SPECIES_BULBASAUR] = sBulbasaurLevelUpLearnset,
...
	[SPECIES_EXEGGUTOR_A] = sExeggutorALevelUpLearnset,
...
	[SPECIES_PIKACHU_CAP_PARTNER] = sPikachuLevelUpLearnset,
	[SPECIES_PICHU_SPIKY] = sPichuLevelUpLearnset,
	[SPECIES_XERNEAS_NATURAL] = sXerneasLevelUpLearnset,
};
#endif

Just match the species defined in Include/species.h to the learnset you created in table 1.
Simple as that!
