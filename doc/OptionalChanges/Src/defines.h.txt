DPE Master/Src/defines.h
----------------------------

This is a really simple file to edit, as theres only 3 lines you need to pay attention to.

#define EXPAND_LEARNSETS

If you're using this feature, make sure you insert the Complete Fire Red Upgrade afterwards or the game will crash.
Comment out this line if you're using the CFRU to expand movesets.

I recommend doing so, as CFRU is intended to be among the last things you insert.
If you are going to test out your hack before using CFRU, I recommend adding // before that #define!
Always make backups!

#define NUM_TMSHMS 128
#define NUM_MOVE_TUTOR_MOVES 128

These just define how many TMs+HMs, and how many move tutors there will be in your hack.
Customize the tables affected by that.
